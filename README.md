   cd flask-books-management-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```

3. Create the database:
   - Log in to your MySQL server and run the `books.sql` script to set up the database and table.
   ```bash
   mysql -u your_user -p < books.sql
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:
   ```env
   MYSQL_HOST=localhost
   MYSQL_USER=your_mysql_user
   MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
   MYSQL_DB=flask_books
   ```

- **Edit Book**: Click the "Edit" button next to a book to update its details.
- **Delete Book**: Click the "Delete" button next to a book to remove it from the collection.

## Database Setup

The `books.sql` file contains the SQL script to create the database and `books` table:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS flask_books;
USE flask_books;

CREATE TABLE books (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(100),
    author VARCHAR(100),
    pages INT,
    genre VARCHAR(50),
    summary TEXT
);
```

## Environment Variables

Ensure the `.env` file contains the correct credentials for your MySQL server:
```env
MYSQL_HOST=localhost
MYSQL_USER=your_mysql_user
MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
MYSQL_DB=flask_books
```
